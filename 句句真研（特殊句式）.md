# 倒装句

## 部分倒装句
只有三种情况需要倒装：
### 否定副词在句首

Example:
- ...perhaps <u>never before</u> **has it served** so much to connect different peoples and nations as in the recent events in Europe.
- <u>Not Only</u> **did they develop** such a device but by the turn of the millennium they had also managed to embed it in a worldwide system.

### `only`在句首

- <u>Only recnetly</u> **did linguists begin** the serious study of languages that were very different from their own.

### 虚拟条件句省略`if`

- But **had Entergy kept** its word,that debate would be beside the point.

  但是，如果Entergy公司信守承诺的话，正义就无关紧要了。
