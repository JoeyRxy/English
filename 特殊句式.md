## 倒装句

### 部分倒装句
只有三种情况需要倒装：
#### 否定副词在句首

Example:
- ...perhaps <u>never before</u> **has it served** so much to connect different peoples and nations as in the recent events in Europe.
- <u>Not Only</u> **did they develop** such a device but by the turn of the millennium they had also managed to embed it in a worldwide system.

#### `only`在句首

- <u>Only recnetly</u> **did linguists begin** the serious study of languages that were very different from their own.

### 虚拟条件句省略`if`

- But **had Entergy kept** its word,that debate would be beside the point.

## 各种前置后置IMPORTANT
重点在于：动词后面接了一个明显不是宾语的成分，那么就要考虑是否进行了 句式的调整——将较长的句子放在后面
