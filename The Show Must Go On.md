# The Show Must Go on

## $\mathscr{Queen}$

Empty Spaces, what we are living for?

Abandoned places, I guess we know the score.

on and on

does anybody know what we are looking for?

another hero, another mindless crime

behind the curtain in the pantomime

hold the line

does anybody want to take it anymore

the show must go on

the show must go on

inside my heart is breaking

my make-up may be flaking

But my smile still stays on

wahtever happens I leave it all to chance

Another heartache, another failed rommance

On and on

Does anybody know what we are living for?

I guess I'm warmer now

I'll soon be truning round the corner now

outside the dawn is breaking

But inside the dark I'm aching to be free

The show must go on

The show must go on

Oh inside my heart is breaking

my make-up may be flaking

But my smile still stays on

Yeah 

my soul is painted like wings of butterflies

Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die

I can fly -my friends

The show must go on

The show must go on

I face it with a grin

I'm never giving in

On with the show

I'll top the bill

I'll ovekill

I have to find the will to carry on

On with the show

The show must go on
